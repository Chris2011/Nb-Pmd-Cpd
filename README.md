This is a new version of the plugin PMD's Copy/Paste Detector for Netbeans. Original version can be found here but its outdated: http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/1529/pmd-s-copy-paste-detector.

If anyone will join the plugin, I will add you as a contributor. What you have to do is to clone the repo and to checkout the second branch called develop. The project was created with gitflow:
